# App Store Resubmission Guide

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Guest Access Implementation

  - ✅ Feedback form
- Account-specific features now clearly indicate login requirement:
  - Catch Log (shows "Sign in to save logs")
  - History (shows "Sign in to view history")
- Added sign-in button in header for guest users

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Removed forced auth redirect
- `app/(tabs)/catchlog/index.tsx` - Added guest-friendly prompts

## App Store Review Response

### For Guideline 5.1.1 - Data Collection and Storage:

**Response:**
"We have updated the app to allow users to access general features without requiring registration. Users can now:

1. **Access core features immediately:** Fly recommendations, map functionality, and feedback submission work without any account creation.

2. **Clear account requirements:** Only features that require data storage (catch logging and history) now prompt users to sign in, with clear messaging about why authentication is needed.

3. **Optional account creation:** Users can choose to create an account only if they want to save their fishing logs and access their personal history."

### For Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Account Deletion:

**Response:**
"We have implemented a complete account deletion feature that allows users to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data:

1. **Location:** Account deletion is available in the Settings tab (visible only to authenticated users).

2. **Process:** Multi-step confirmation process prevents accidental deletion:
   - Initial warning about permanent data loss
   - Final confirmation with detailed data deletion list
   - Clear success/failure feedback

3. **Data deletion:** Permanently removes user account and all associated data including fishing logs, preferences, and personal information.

4. **Error handling:** Includes contact support option for any deletion issues.

The feature is easily accessible and requires no external website visits or customer service contact."
