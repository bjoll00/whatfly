# ⏰ Time-of-Day Specific Fly Recommendations

## Overview
The fly suggestion system now dynamically adjusts recommendations based on the time of day, mimicking how fish feeding behavior changes throughout a 24-hour cycle.

## 🌅 Dawn (5am-8am) - "The Early Riser"

**Prime Patterns:**
- **Midges** (+50 points): "Dawn midge hatches are legendary"
- **Spinners** (+60 points): "Spinner falls peak at dawn"
- **BWOs** (+45 points): "BWOs love cool dawn conditions"
- **Small Dries** (+30 points, size 18+): "Small dries effective at dawn"
- **Nymphs** (+25 points): "Pre-hatch nymphing at dawn"

**Avoid:**
- **Mouse Patterns** (-40 points): "Too light for mouse patterns"

**Why:** Dawn is when overnight insect hatches culminate in spinner falls. Cool temperatures trigger Blue Winged Olive activity. Fish are hungry after the night.

---

## ☀️ Morning (8am-12pm) - "Prime Dry Fly Time"

**Prime Patterns:**
- **PMDs** (+55 points): "PMD hatches are named after mornings!"
- **Caddis** (+45 points): "Morning caddis hatches common"
- **All Dry Flies** (+40 points): "Morning dry fly action"
- **Terrestrials** (+35 points): "Terrestrials active in morning warmth"
- **Nymphs** (+20 points): "Nymphs always work in morning"

**Avoid:**
- **Mouse Patterns** (-35 points): "Mouse patterns need darkness"

**Why:** As water warms, insect activity increases. Pale Morning Duns emerge (hence the name). Fish are actively feeding on surface patterns.

---

## ☀️ Midday (12pm-2pm) - "The Tough Hours"

**Prime Patterns:**
- **Small Nymphs** (+40 points, size 16+): "Small nymphs work midday when nothing else does"
- **Midges** (+35 points): "Midges save the midday slump"
- **Streamers** (+30 points): "Streamers can provoke midday strikes"

**Avoid:**
- **Mouse Patterns** (-50 points): "Mouse patterns need low light"
- **Dry Flies** (-20 points): "Tough time for dry flies (fish less active)"

**Why:** Heat and bright sun push fish deeper. They become lethargic. Only small subsurface presentations or aggressive streamer strips work.

---

## 🌤️ Afternoon (2pm-6pm) - "The Hopper Hour"

**Prime Patterns:**
- **Hoppers** (+60 points): "Hoppers most active in warm afternoons"
- **Ants** (+55 points): "Ant falls common in afternoon"
- **Terrestrials** (+50 points): "Peak terrestrial activity in afternoon"
- **Caddis** (+45 points): "Afternoon caddis hatches picking up"
- **Dry Flies** (+35 points): "Dry fly action resumes"
- **Streamers** (+30 points): "Streamers working as light changes"

**Why:** This is THE time for grasshoppers and terrestrials. As temperatures peak, land insects become active and end up in the water. Fish know this and actively patrol banks.

---

## 🌆 Dusk (6pm-8pm) - "Magic Hour"

**Prime Patterns:**
- **Spinners** (+70 points): "Spinner falls dominate at dusk"
- **Large Streamers** (+55 points, size 8 or larger): "Large streamers excel as light fades"
- **Caddis** (+50 points): "Evening caddis emergence"
- **Stoneflies** (+45 points): "Stoneflies active at dusk"
- **Large Dries** (+40 points, size 14 or larger): "Larger dries effective at dusk"
- **Mouse Patterns** (+40 points): "Getting dark enough for mouse patterns"

**Why:** Dusk is legendary for a reason. As light fades, fish feel safe to feed aggressively. Large insects emerge. Big fish start hunting. The transition to mouse fishing begins.

---

## 🌙 Night (8pm-5am) - "MOUSE TIME!"

**PRIME PATTERNS:**
- **🐭 MOUSE PATTERNS** (+100 points): **"PRIME MOUSE PATTERN TIME - big fish hunting!"**
- **Sculpin** (+70 points): "Sculpin patterns mimic nocturnal baitfish"
- **Large Dark Streamers** (+65 points, size 6 or larger): "Large dark streamers for night hunting"
- **Dark Woolly Buggers** (+55 points): "Dark woolly buggers work at night"
- **Leech Patterns** (+50 points): "Leech patterns effective at night"

**AVOID:**
- **Dry Flies** (-40 points): "Can't see dry flies at night"
- **Small Nymphs** (-30 points, size 16+): "Small nymphs difficult at night"
- **Most Other Patterns** (-25 points): "Night fishing demands big, dark flies"

**Why:** This is when big brown trout become apex predators. They actively hunt mice, voles, and baitfish. Visibility is low, so they rely on vibration and profile. ONLY large, dark, noisy flies work. Mouse patterns create a wake that triggers explosive surface strikes from trophy fish.

## 🎯 Pattern-Specific Examples

### Mouse Fly Throughout the Day:

| Time | Score | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Dawn | -40 | Too light, fish aren't hunting mammals |
| Morning | -35 | Daylight makes mouse unnatural |
| Midday | -50 | Worst possible time |
| Afternoon | -30 | Still too bright |
| Dusk | +40 | Light fading, hunt mode activating |
| **Night** | **+100** | **PRIME TIME - trophy fish hunting!** |

### PMD (Pale Morning Dun):

| Time | Score | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Dawn | +30 | Some activity |
| **Morning** | **+55** | **Named for this time - peak hatch!** |
| Midday | +10 | Hatch slowing |
| Afternoon | +20 | Some stragglers |
| Dusk | +15 | Mostly done |
| Night | -20 | Ineffective |

### Hopper:

| Time | Score | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Dawn | +10 | Too cold for hoppers |
| Morning | +35 | Getting active |
| Midday | +45 | Warming up |
| **Afternoon** | **+60** | **Peak activity - hoppers everywhere!** |
| Dusk | +30 | Still some |
| Night | -25 | Hoppers don't fly at night |

## 📊 Impact on Recommendations

### Before Time-Based Scoring:
- Same flies recommended regardless of time
- Mouse patterns never surfaced
- No consideration of natural feeding cycles
- Generic, unhelpful suggestions

### After Time-Based Scoring:
- **Dynamic by hour**: Different flies for 8am vs. 8pm
- **Mouse patterns dominate at night** (+100 bonus)
- **Terrestrials peak in afternoon** (+60 for hoppers)
- **Realistic feeding cycles**: Matches nature
- **Educational**: Users learn when patterns work

---

## 🌟 Key Insights

1. **Mouse flies are game-changers at night** - Now properly recognized with +100 point bonus
2. **Terrestrials rule afternoon** - Hoppers and ants get massive boosts 2pm-6pm
3. **Midday is tough** - System honestly downgrades dry flies, suggests deep/small
4. **Dusk is magic** - Large patterns get priority as light fades
5. **Dawn spinners** - Spinner falls properly recognized at dawn

## 🎓 Educational Value

Users now learn:
- "Oh, mouse patterns work at NIGHT, not during the day!"
- "PMDs are called Pale MORNING Duns for a reason"
- "Midday is tough - go small or go deep"
- "Afternoon is hopper time"
- "Dusk spinner falls are a thing"

This makes the app not just useful, but **educational** - users become better anglers!
